Top 10 ML Models for Cyber Threat Intelligence 


Model Name 

Primary Use Case 

Why it’s "Best" for your Project 

1 

XGBoost 

Multi-class Classification 

Fastest inference time; perfect for real-time dashboard updates. 

2 

Isolation Forest 

Anomaly Detection 

Identifies "unknown" threats without needing labeled attack logs. 

3 

LSTM (RNN) 

Temporal Trend Analysis 

Captures sequential patterns; essential for "Trend Detection" module. 

4 

Random Forest 

Malware Detection 

Highly robust; prevents overfitting on small or imbalanced datasets. 

5 

BERT 

Log Parsing/NLP 

Transforms raw text logs into structured data for better visualization. 

6 

Autoencoders 

Reconstructive Anomaly 

Flags subtle deviations by failing to "reconstruct" malicious traffic. 

7 

CNN 

Traffic Pattern Recognition 

Converts network flow into "images" to detect visual attack patterns. 

8 

K-Means 

Behavior Clustering 

Groups similar suspicious IPs to identify botnets on your map. 

9 

SVM 

Perimeter Defense 

High precision for binary classification (Safe vs. Malicious). 

10 

Naive Bayes 

Phishing/Spam Filter 

Extremely lightweight; ideal for high-speed preprocessing in Module 1. 

 

How These Models Work in Your Project 

XGBoost: The Decision Engine 

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) works by building a series of decision trees where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous one. In your project, it takes the structured logs from Module 1 and predicts the specific attack type (e.g., DDoS, SQLi, or Brute Force) with over 99% accuracy. Because it is optimized for speed, your dashboard can refresh almost instantly. 

Isolation Forest: The Outlier Detector 

Instead of learning what an attack looks like, this model learns how to "isolate" data. Since attacks are rare and different from normal traffic, they require fewer "splits" to be isolated in a tree structure. This provides the Anomaly Score used in your "Trend and Anomaly Detection" outcome. 

LSTM: The Time-Series Forecaster 

LSTMs are designed for data with a time dimension. It remembers previous states of network traffic to determine if the current sequence is malicious. This allows your dashboard to show spikes and seasonality—identifying if an attack is a one-time event or part of a slow, multi-day pattern. 

 

The Absolute Best Model: XGBoost 

After research, XGBoost is the best model for a visualization-heavy project like yours for three specific reasons: 

Low Latency: In 2026 benchmarks, XGBoost is roughly 14% faster than Random Forest in inference time. For an interactive dashboard, speed is everything. 

Explainability (SHAP/Feature Importance): It doesn't just give a "Yes/No." It can tell you which feature (e.g., bytes_out or dst_port) led to the risk score. You can display this directly in your Vulnerability Prioritization charts. 

Handling Imbalance: Cybersecurity data is famously imbalanced (mostly normal traffic). XGBoost handles this better than deep learning models without needing massive computational power.
